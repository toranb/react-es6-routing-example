A react web app with nested routes and integration tests!


To run the react app locally

    npm install
    gulp

    python -m SimpleHTTPServer 3000

    visit http://localhost:3000 to see the running app


To run the react tests

    npm install
    gulp test

**after the update to react-nested-router 0.2.0**

    Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'firstChild' of undefined

The app still seems to function just fine -just unsure of why this error
started showing up only after the 0.2.0 upgrade
